# Harlequin
## About
Harlequin is a utility designed for verifiying students' emails to their discord
usernames. It mainly acts as an access control mechanism to ensure the server
is populated by only students. All technical information can be found in the
included pdf documents, such as requirements for operation and detailed minutia
of the functions. Some more information on how to get started can be found
below.

## Setup
The pdf document titled "**Requirements.pdf**" encapsulates all required
components of the project outside the code. You'll find table schemas and the
recommended attributes for the database.

#### A note on technical documentation
An additional pdf document will be added shortly on the technical aspects of
the program, as well as recommendations of settings if implemented in various
other environments.

## Points of Contact
You're welcome to reach me at [my school email](mailto:nchri49@wgu.edu) or on
discord at **Ursa#1337**.

#### A note on completion
This page isn't complete; it's not intended to be complete. Further work will
be done to improve the readability and depth of information when I am able to
attend to it.
